        faq_a1: "Nein. Wir verkaufen keine Generatoren, Solarpanels oder Batterien direkt. Unsere Rolle besteht darin, Energielösungen zu koordinieren — was Beschaffung, Lieferantenverifizierung, technische Abstimmung und Projektkoordination umfasst.",
        faq_q2: "Wie wählen Sie Lieferanten aus?",
        faq_a2: "Wir bewerten Lieferanten basierend auf technischer Fähigkeit, Compliance-Dokumentation, Lieferhistorie und Eignung für spezifische Projektanforderungen. Wir wahren Unabhängigkeit und bevorzugen keinen einzelnen Hersteller.",
        faq_q3: "In welchen Regionen sind Sie tätig?",
        faq_a3: "Wir arbeiten hauptsächlich in Europa (EU-Compliance-Märkte), Ukraine (Wiederaufbau- und Resilienzprojekte) und Afrika (netzunabhängige und industrielle Energie). Wir passen Lösungen an regionale Standards und Logistik an.",
        faq_q4: "Wie lange dauert der Koordinationsprozess?",
        faq_a4: "Es hängt von der Projektkomplexität ab. Einfache Anforderungsanalyse und Lieferantenbeschaffung können 1-2 Wochen dauern. Vollständige Projektkoordination kann von Wochen bis Monaten reichen.",
        faq_q5: "Bieten Sie Installations- oder EPC-Dienstleistungen an?",
        faq_a5: "Wir bieten keine direkten Installations- oder EPC-Dienstleistungen an. Wir können jedoch mit lokalen EPC-Auftragnehmern koordinieren, technische Spezifikationen abstimmen und den Übergabeprozess unterstützen.",
